            <h2> The Project</h2>
            <p> The goal of this project was to design an interactive interface for an emerging startup. 
                The project consisted of four major parts: (1) sketching ideas of the interface, (2) creating an interactive, 
                high-fidelity prototype, (3) conducting user testing on a final, revised prototype, and (4) contacting the start up. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Ozone is “the world’s first fully collaborative video editor in the cloud” (from YCombinator). 
                The product will allow you to upload and edit high quality footage with other people. The 
                company describes it as “Figma for video.” They also say that the editor will work even without 
                a good wifi connection or powerful computer.

            <h2>Part I: Ideation and Sketching</h2>
            <p> With these goals in mind, we generally want to design 
                this app with all the features present in other video editors that we’re already familiar with. 
                 We will also have to come up with some new features that make it clear how collaboration will work.

            <h3>Prototype Design Choices</h3>
            <p>Because this is a collaborative video editing software, we needed 
                to think about special features to include in our design. We decided to include a 
                share button, similar to many Google products. It was also challenging to think 
                about how collaborative video editing would actually work. One idea we came up with 
                was the concept of a “lock.” Essentially, if a user locks a video or audio file, 
                it prevents other users from editing it at the same time. This helps eliminate 
                potential issues with contiguous editing. Also, the idea is that nobody would actually 
                have to take time to download / update files unless they are unlocked. This would hopefully
                make the workflow smoother, since each user wouldn’t have to constantly refresh the 
                project after any edit is made.</p>

            <p>
                At our Studio, we recieved feedback which was critical to revising our prototype. 
                Here is the most important feedback we recieved:
            </p>
            <li>Aesthetic theme not consistent </li>
            <li>Misalignment of elements between different screens</li>
            <li>Unclear functionality of buttons such as FaceTime and chat buttons</li>
            <li>Users not sure what a “lock” is or how to start one</li>
            <li>Button mismapping and deadends </li>
            <p>
                Using this feedback, we edited our prototype to its current version

            <h3>Results and Analysis</h3>
            <li>One user did successfully create a new project by choosing the “Choose From Library” option. 
                However, they did not realize they had created a project, likely because we did not actually 
                build out the screen for choosing a video clip from their library due to the limits of the 
                scope of the project. We could have improved this section of our interface by only enabling 
                the user to create a new project by clicking the “Create New Project” button, rather than 
                having both the “Choose From Library” and “Upload Clip” buttons link to the main editing screen. 
                The user also suggested that we include some sort of notification letting them know that they had 
                successfully created a new project. <br> <br>
            </li>
            <li>One user had difficulty opening the chat and video chat functions. This was because they were 
                accidentally zoomed in on the prototype, and could only view a part of the screen, therefore the 
                buttons for those two functions (located on the bottom left) were not visible. This was more of an 
                error of the prototyping software rather than our fault, however we could have been more careful 
                before submitting the link to ensure that the “Fit to Screen” mode was selected. <br> <br>
            </li>
            <li>One user also expected the chat function to be available from the profile home page (where the 
                projects are located). However, this was a conscious design choice on our part to only locate it 
                within the main editing page, because the idea was that you can hop on a video call with the 
                people you are collaborating with on a specific project. She didn’t seem to understand she was 
                looking at a screen grab from a video chat. This could have been remedied by adding captions 
                identifying each of the speakers beneath their videos.   <br> <br>
            </li>
            <li>A couple of users were confused by the task to enter full screen mode, thinking they were supposed
                to enter the website into full screen, rather than put the video clip into full screen mode. We 
                could have worded our task more clearly, e.g. “put the video clip in full screen mode.” <br> <br>
            </li>
            <li>One user criticized the Main Audio Theme folder, claiming that although it makes sense to click on
                it to open it, the UX wasn’t immediately intuitive. She did not like how big the icons were. This 
                could have been improved by having the Main Audio Theme and other folders be dropdowns within the 
                same side bar, rather than having them open another container. <br> <br>
            </li>
            <li>Despite only having a brief description of how the locking function worked, all users intuitively 
                knew what the purpose of the locking function would be. <br> <br>
            </li>
            <li>Overall, despite these small bugs, the users collectively found our UX easy to use, intuitive, 
                clear, and user-friendly. All other tasks we asked the users to complete besides those mentioned 
                above went smoothly and quickly for all users. One user compared it to another existing video
                editing software she’d used, saying it held up very well in comparison. <br> <br>
            </li>
